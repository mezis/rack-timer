# rack-timer

Are you spending too much time in Rack middlewares?

Is one of your Rack middlewares misbehaving in production?

Add `RackTimer::Middleware` to the to of your middleware stack and figure out.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mezis/rack-timer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mezis/rack-timer)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rack-timer'

Add the middleware to your stack. In your `config.ru`, add this before any other
middleware:

    require 'rack-timer'
    use RackTimer::Middleware

When your app runs, it will output timing information to standard error.
If you want to change that, you can tell `rack-timer` to send data to another
file-y object, for instance:

    RackTimer.output = $stdout

If you want to send execution time to StatsD as well, you can specify a client:

    RackTimer.statsd = $statsd

## Usage

Run your app normally after installation, wait a while, and download your logs.

They will report the middleware starting up:

    [rack-timer] assimilating: Rack::MiddlewareTimer
    [rack-timer] assimilating: Rack::Lock
    [rack-timer] assimilating: Airbrake::UserInformer
    [rack-timer] assimilating: Rack::DetectCrawler

then timing each request:

    [rack-timer] Proc took 3398135 us
    [rack-timer] Rack::Cors took 54 us
    [rack-timer] Rack::OutOfBandGC took 51 us
    ...
    [rack-timer] Airbrake::UserInformer took 74 us
    [rack-timer] Rack::Lock took 78 us
    [rack-timer] Rack::MiddlewareTimer took 80 us
    [rack-timer] queued for 5256 us

Besides middleware timing, two bits of extra information are reported:

- `Proc` (the first entry for each request) typically is your app itself
  (excluding middleware).
- `queued for...` will be present if your web frontend adds the `X-Request-Start`
  HTTP header. If using Nginx+Unicorn or Apache+Passenger, this will report the
  queueing time in Unicorn or Passenger.

## An example

We developed this because of wierd issues with queuing time (was too high
without an obvious reason).

We graphed the middleware timings:

And the queueing timings:

(horizontally: log10 of the queuing time in microseconds, ie. 3 is 1ms and 6 is
1 second)

The conlusion was that something what causing queuing in some cases. It turned
out our out-of-band garbage colleciton hack was no longer compatible with
Passenger, and removing it solved the issue:
